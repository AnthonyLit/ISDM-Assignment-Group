## Luke Phillips, Kenny Tran, Anthony Nguyen Tran, Nam Dang

## Project Objectives:
This project is commissioned by a major travel company and aims to improve their existing call management system for sales of holiday packages. This will be achieved through better management of relationship manager (RM) skills customer demographics to correctly assign RMs to customers who require their knowledge. The objective is to reduce wait times and ensure chosen representatives have the product knowledge required by each customer's enquiry. This change is to improve customer experience and therefore improve the likelihood of initial product purchases and repeat business from customers. Additionally, the project aims to improve the experience for repeat customers, encouraging more purchases from the agency. All of these objectives will improve revenue for the agency and improve brand image with customers as a reliable service.

## Problem Definition:
* During Busy Times, customers are directed to an interactive voice response system which results in lower levels of customer engagement and loss of opportunities.
* Priority/Repeated/Potential clients hang up whilst in the waiting queue.
* For Outbound calls, the Target List formed using the 'tuple method' is very vague and lacking critical information as it does not gather enough details.
* Interactive Voice Response Unit does not cater for all customer's accessibility needs such as verbal impediments or language difficulties.

## Stakeholders:
The project has a series of stakeholders including:
* The travel company - business outcomes and revenue affected by the system's correct operation.
* Relationship managers (RMs) - will be using the system daily and must be able to navigate its functions correctly.
* Profiler tool - must correctly interface with the new system to generate customer profiles.
* End customers - will take their business to other organisations if the system results in long wait times or poor service.
