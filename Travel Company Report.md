## Luke Phillips, Kenny Tran, Anthony Nguyen Tran, Nam Dang

## Project Objectives:
This project is commissioned by a major travel company and aims to improve their existing call management system for sales of holiday packages. This will be achieved through better management of relationship manager (RM) skills customer demographics to correctly assign RMs to customers who require their knowledge. The objective is to reduce wait times and ensure chosen representatives have the product knowledge required by each customer's enquiry. This change is to improve customer experience and therefore improve the likelihood of initial product purchases and repeat business from customers. Additionally, the project aims to improve the experience for repeat customers, encouraging more purchases from the agency. All of these objectives will improve revenue for the agency and improve brand image with customers as a reliable service.

## Problem Definition:
* During Busy Times, customers are directed to an interactive voice response system which results in lower levels of customer engagement and loss of opportunities.
* Priority, Repeated and Potential clients hang up whilst in the waiting queue.

## Stakeholders:
The project has a series of stakeholders including:
* The travel company - business outcomes and revenue affected by the system's correct operation.
* Relationship managers (RMs) - will be using the system daily and must be able to navigate its functions correctly.
* Profiler tool - must correctly interface with the new system to generate customer profiles.
* End customers - will take their business to other organisations if the system results in long wait times or poor service.

## Project Assumptions:
* Server and storage capacity is sufficient for all processess in the solution.
* The company's telephone connection is already in place and outages will be managed by the provider.
* The existing telephone and internet connection bandwidth will be sufficient.
* RMs are able to see customer scores generated by the profiler tool.

## Empathy Maps:
**Company Point of View** <br/>
**Think and feel:**
* Current situation is that RMs are unable to provide exceptional service to customers due “varying number and nature of holiday packages”.
* RMs cannot possess all the knowledge of the company products but instead they do have in depth knowledge of some particular products and can provide exceptional service to some customer they contacted frequently.
* The current operation however is restricting RMs to perform what they are best at as a consequence their customers might experience poor services.

**See:**
* The company is currently seeing poor customer service due the complicated nature of their current system.
* Their system is restring potential RMs to performs the best of their ability as a consequence their customers are not putting their trust to the company.
* Due to poor customer service products are not as appealing in the marketplace. So, boosting the customer service might automatically increase the present of the products in the marketplace.

**Hear:**
* RMs does not have the required/appropriate for a particular product and while helping customer without the essential required knowledge lead to complaint from their customers such as poor services, RMs are not qualified, etc.
* This particular company may not be reliable as compared to other companies (i.e. their competitors).
* Customer feedback does not have the opportunity to talk and receive advice from an appropriate RMs.

**Pain:**
* RMs being match with new customers and/or existing customers where RMs have little knowledge about the products as a result unable to satisfied customers for their queries.
* Company’s revenue and its present on the market can drastically falling if the performance of the company continues to unsatisfied more customers.

**Gain:**
* If RMs can be matched (inbound call) to the appropriate customers where RMs’ performance and knowledge can be helpful for those particular customers, RMs will have the opportunity to deliver the best possible customer service to meet customer’s satisfaction.
* Customers’ satisfaction be can increase and will be continue to increase in the future, company’s revenue can be simultaneously increase as well which then allows the company to maintain its present on the market by being able to financially afford marketing and recruiting its employees.

**Customer Point of View** <br/>
**Think and Feel:**
* They may feel frustrated about the poor customer service they received from the RMs on call. 
* They may think that the company is unreliable for providing customers with desired information. 

**See:**
* Other customers and friends saying that they will switch to another company as representatives do not always have the correct knowledge of my desired product

**Hear:**
* They may hear from relatives or friends saying that the travel company is unreliable for desired information. 
* They may hear from RMs saying that they do not have the desired information. 

**Pain:**
* Being linked with a relationship manager with poor knowledge about the destination and traditions of a holiday package. 
* Long wait times when making inbound calls. 

**Gain:**
* When linked with a RM, can receive adequate information regarding the user’s desired holiday package. 
* Is informed enough to choose whether to purchase or reject the holiday package. 

## Brainstorm of Solutions:
* Adjust the call flow rate for both inbound and outbound calls by matching RMs and end-customers according to RMs skills and customers profiles.
* One way to improve the call flow rate is to match customers based on RM performance and product knowledge. For example, the system would do well in matching end-customers to well informed RMs with appropriate knowledge about the destination and its tradition (for both outbound and inbound).
* A typical RM matching technique is segmenting customers into social and cultural segment according to their postcodes and surnames (using profiler tool). For RM profile may be depend on the age, sex, culture, language proficiency, experience and product knowledge. The system will utilise their profiles as a skill matcher between end-customers and RMs.
* Newcomer RM profile need to be collected and initialised at hiring by taking 10 minutes questionnaires. We will then provide RM initial profiles for the system and the system will adjust according to RMs subsequent performance in selling packages and customers service.
* Customers are given language options for the Interactive Voice Response system
* Phone System notifies customers of que waiting times in minues/hours and gives the option for a call back
* Customers have the option to choose their own RM 
* Interactive Voice Response is also available through touch tone for customers with speaking disabilities 
**Point 3 solution is based on assumption and thus does not need to further implementation/solve to achieve this solution. For other solutions need to implement a way to achieve this solution.**

## Project Backlog:
**User Stories - Customer**

## Competitive Advantages:


## Effects of Failure:


## Agile Methodology Used:
To complete this project, we have implemented the SCRUM methodology. We have treated each week as a sprint and created a new category of the report in each iteration based on that week's guidelines.
We have used GitHub issues to generate a project backlog for report creation which are organised by the week (sprint) that they need to be completed in. These issues in the backlog are assigned to team members whose job it is to complete those tasks. Each person has used commit messages to document their progress as they submit changes to their assigned tasks and closed issues when that element of the backlog is complete.
