Problem Definition 
- During Busy Times, customers are directed to an interactive voice response system which results in lower levels of customer engagement and loss of opportunities. 
- Priority/Repeated/Potential clients hang up whilst in the waiting que
- For Outbound calls the Target List formed using the tuple method is very vague and lacking critical information as it does not gather enough details. (Outbound list can be overlapped with inbound for leads)
- The scoring system for inbound calls using the 1-10 based method uses call duration/handling time which should not be the basis for probability in sales. 
(Should have a system where outbound call numbers are ticked off whenenever outbound number has been in contact) 
- Interactive Voice Reponse unit does not cater for all customers as a touch tone service should also be available. (Communication problems, customers can be accents or lanuguage difficulties)
