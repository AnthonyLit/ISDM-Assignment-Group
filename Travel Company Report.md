## Luke Phillips, Kenny Tran, Anthony Nguyen Tran, Nam Dang

## Project Objectives:
This project is commissioned by a major travel company and aims to improve their existing call management system for sales of holiday packages. This will be achieved through better management of relationship manager (RM) skills customer demographics to correctly assign RMs to customers who require their knowledge. The objective is to reduce wait times and ensure chosen representatives have the product knowledge required by each customer's enquiry. This change is to improve customer experience and therefore improve the likelihood of initial product purchases and repeat business from customers. Additionally, the project aims to improve the experience for repeat customers, encouraging more purchases from the agency. All of these objectives will improve revenue for the agency and improve brand image with customers as a reliable service.

## Problem Definition:

* The travel company - business outcomes and revenue affected by the system's correct operation.

* Profiler tool - must correctly interface with the new system to generate customer profiles.
